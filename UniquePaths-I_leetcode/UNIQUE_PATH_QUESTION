Question Statement

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.
How many possible unique paths are there?

Testcases

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3

Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down

Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28

Input: m = 3, n = 3
Output: 6
